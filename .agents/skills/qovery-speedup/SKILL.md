# Qovery Speedup Skill

You are an expert at optimizing deployment speed on Qovery. When a user reports slow deployments, follow this skill to measure exactly where time is being spent, identify the bottleneck, classify it as user-controllable or Qovery infrastructure, and either fix it or generate a diagnostic report for Qovery support.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user says anything like:
- "My deployments are slow"
- "Speed up my Qovery deployment"
- "Why does my deployment take so long?"
- "Optimize my build time"
- "My app takes too long to start"
- "My Docker build is slow"
- "The health check keeps timing out"
- "My deployment is taking 20 minutes"
- "How can I deploy faster?"
- "My image pull is slow"
- "Can you analyze my deployment pipeline?"

---

## PHASE 1: Measure — Deployment Timeline Analysis

Before optimizing anything, MEASURE where time is actually being spent. Do NOT guess — use data.

### 1.1 Gather Structured Deployment History (V2 API)

The V2 deployment history API provides a complete 3-level breakdown: environment total, per-stage, and per-service — all with durations.

**Via MCP (preferred):**
```
"Show me the deployment history for {environment}"
"How long did the last deployment take?"
"What services took the longest to deploy?"
```

**Via API — V2 endpoint (primary data source):**
```bash
# Get last 5 deployments with full stage/service breakdown and durations
curl -s -H "Authorization: Token $QOVERY_API_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.qovery.com/environment/{envId}/deploymentHistoryV2?pageSize=5" | jq '.results[] | {
    execution_id: .identifier.execution_id,
    status: .status,
    total_duration: .total_duration,
    trigger: .trigger_action,
    triggered_by: .auditing_data.triggered_by,
    origin: .auditing_data.origin,
    stages: [.stages[] | {
      name: .name,
      status: .status,
      duration: .duration,
      services: [.services[] | {
        name: .identifier.name,
        type: .identifier.service_type,
        status: .status,
        total_duration: .total_duration,
        build_pod_name: .details.build_pod_name
      }]
    }]
  }'
```

This returns structured data like:
```json
{
  "execution_id": "abc123-42",
  "status": "DEPLOYED",
  "total_duration": "PT12M34S",
  "stages": [
    {
      "name": "Infrastructure",
      "status": "DONE",
      "duration": "PT3M10S",
      "services": [
        {"name": "postgres", "type": "DATABASE", "total_duration": "PT3M10S"},
        {"name": "redis", "type": "HELM", "total_duration": "PT2M45S"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Backend",
      "status": "DONE",
      "duration": "PT8M42S",
      "services": [
        {"name": "backend", "type": "APPLICATION", "total_duration": "PT8M42S", "build_pod_name": "build-abc123-42-0"},
        {"name": "worker", "type": "APPLICATION", "total_duration": "PT4M20S"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

IMPORTANT: Durations are in ISO 8601 format (e.g., `PT8M42S` = 8 minutes 42 seconds). Parse accordingly.

### 1.2 Generate Build Runner Usage Report

For services with a build step (applications and jobs from Git source), generate a Grafana snapshot showing CPU, memory, and network I/O during the build:

```bash
# Get the execution_id from the V2 deployment history response
# Then generate the build runner report
curl -s -X POST "https://api.qovery.com/environment/{envId}/deploymentBuildUsageReport" \
  -H "Authorization: Token $QOVERY_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "execution_id": "{execution_id_from_v2}",
    "report_expiration_in_seconds": 86400
  }' | jq '{report_url, delete_report_url}'
```

The `execution_id` comes directly from the V2 deployment history response (`identifier.execution_id`). It is an incremental number assigned by Qovery to each deployment execution.

The returned `report_url` is a publicly accessible Grafana snapshot (expires after 24 hours) showing:
- Build pod CPU usage over time
- Build pod memory usage over time
- Build pod network I/O
- Timeline from build start to ~40 minutes after

Share this URL with the user — it's the most powerful diagnostic for build performance.

### 1.3 Parse Deployment Logs for Sub-Step Timing

The V2 API gives per-service total duration, but NOT the sub-step breakdown within a service (git clone vs build vs push vs scheduling vs startup vs health check). For that, parse the deployment logs:

**Via CLI:**
```bash
qovery log --application "name" --since 30m
```

**Via API:**
```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Token $QOVERY_API_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.qovery.com/application/{appId}/log" | jq '.results[] | .message'
```

Look for timestamped step markers in the logs:
```
[HH:MM:SS] Cloning repository...
[HH:MM:SS] Clone completed
[HH:MM:SS] Building Docker image...
[HH:MM:SS] Step 1/12: FROM node:22-alpine
...
[HH:MM:SS] Build completed
[HH:MM:SS] Pushing image...
[HH:MM:SS] Push completed
[HH:MM:SS] Deploying to Kubernetes...
[HH:MM:SS] Pod scheduled
[HH:MM:SS] Container started
[HH:MM:SS] Readiness probe passed
[HH:MM:SS] Service is running
```

Calculate the time between each step to build the sub-step timeline.

### 1.4 Compare Across Deployments

Analyze the last 5-10 deployments to establish a baseline and detect trends:

```
Deployment History Comparison:
| # | Date       | Total   | Slowest Stage    | Slowest Service | Status    |
|---|------------|---------|------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| 5 | 2025-04-20 | 12m 34s | Backend (8m 42s) | backend (8m 42s)| DEPLOYED  |
| 4 | 2025-04-19 | 11m 22s | Backend (7m 50s) | backend (7m 50s)| DEPLOYED  |
| 3 | 2025-04-18 | 14m 10s | Backend (10m 5s) | backend (10m 5s)| DEPLOYED  |
| 2 | 2025-04-17 | 6m 45s  | Backend (4m 12s) | backend (4m 12s)| DEPLOYED  |
| 1 | 2025-04-15 | 6m 30s  | Backend (4m 05s) | backend (4m 05s)| DEPLOYED  |
```

Questions to answer:
- **Is deployment time getting worse over time?** (growing codebase, more dependencies)
- **Was there a specific deployment where it jumped?** (what commit/change caused it?)
- **Are some services consistently slower than others?** (focus optimization there)
- **Is the total time dominated by one stage or spread across many?** (serial vs parallel issue)

### 1.5 Present the Timeline

Generate a clear timeline visualization for the user:

```
Deployment Pipeline for environment "production" (last deployment: 12m 34s)

Stage: Infrastructure (3m 10s)
  ├── postgres (DATABASE)     3m 10s  [Qovery managed]
  └── redis (HELM)            2m 45s  [Qovery managed]

Stage: Backend (8m 42s)                              ← SLOWEST STAGE
  ├── backend (APPLICATION)   8m 42s  [has build]    ← SLOWEST SERVICE
  │   ├── Git clone:          0m 08s  (1%)
  │   ├── Docker build:       6m 15s  (72%)          ← BOTTLENECK
  │   ├── Image push:         0m 35s  (7%)
  │   ├── Pod scheduling:     0m 18s  (3%)
  │   ├── App startup:        1m 06s  (13%)
  │   └── Health check:       0m 20s  (4%)
  └── worker (APPLICATION)    4m 20s  [has build]

Stage: Frontend (5m 15s)
  └── frontend (APPLICATION)  5m 15s  [has build]

Stage: Jobs (1m 30s)
  └── db-migrate (JOB)        1m 30s  [lifecycle]

Total: 12m 34s (stages run sequentially as configured)
```

This timeline is the foundation for everything that follows. Present it to the user before proposing any changes.

---

## PHASE 2: Classify — User vs Qovery

Based on the timeline analysis, classify each bottleneck into who can fix it:

### Classification Table

| Step | Typical Time | Slow If > | Owner | User Can Fix? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Queue time** | 5-30s | 2 min | Qovery | No — contact support |
| **Git clone** | 5-15s | 30s | Mixed | Yes if repo is huge (large files, no `.gitignore`) |
| **Docker build** | 1-10 min | 5 min | User (usually) | Yes — optimize Dockerfile (see Phase 3.1) |
| **Build runner resources** | N/A | CPU at 100% | Qovery | No — contact support for larger build runner |
| **Image push** | 15-60s | 2 min | Mixed | Smaller images help; registry infra is Qovery |
| **Image pull** (containers) | 10-60s | 2 min | Mixed | Smaller images help; registry proximity is Qovery |
| **Pod scheduling** | 10-30s | 2 min | Mixed | Reduce resource requests if too high; Karpenter is Qovery |
| **App startup** | 2-30s | 2 min | User | Yes — optimize startup code, use lifecycle jobs for migrations |
| **Health check** | 5-30s | 1 min | User | Yes — tune probe config (see Phase 3.4) |
| **Deployment stage ordering** | N/A | N/A | User | Yes — parallelize independent services |

### Decision Tree

```
For each bottleneck identified in Phase 1:

Is it user-controllable?
├── YES (Docker build, app startup, health check, stage ordering, image size)
│   └── Go to Phase 3 → diagnose deeper → Phase 4 → fix
│
├── MIXED (git clone, image push/pull, pod scheduling)
│   ├── User part: optimize what you can (image size, resource requests, .gitignore)
│   └── Qovery part: if still slow after user optimizations → Phase 5 → support
│
└── NO (queue time, build runner capacity, registry infra, Karpenter node provisioning)
    └── Go to Phase 5 → generate diagnostic report → contact Qovery support
```

## PHASE 3: Diagnose — Deep Analysis of Bottlenecks

### 3.1 Docker Build Optimization (Most Common Bottleneck)

Analyze the user's Dockerfile and build logs to identify waste. This is where the biggest gains are.

**Step 1: Read the Dockerfile**

Examine the Dockerfile and identify anti-patterns:

| Anti-Pattern | Detection | Fix | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **No layer caching — `COPY . .` before dependency install** | `COPY . .` appears before `npm install` / `pip install` / `go mod download` | Reorder: copy lockfiles first, install deps, then copy code. Deps layer is cached when only code changes. | **HIGH — saves 50-80% of build time** |
| **No `.dockerignore`** | `.dockerignore` file missing or incomplete | Create one: exclude `.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `dist`, `build`, `.env`, `*.md` | **HIGH — reduces build context from GBs to MBs** |
| **No multi-stage build** | Single `FROM` statement, build tools in final image | Convert to multi-stage: build in one stage, copy artifacts to minimal runtime stage | **MEDIUM — smaller image = faster push/pull** |
| **Dev dependencies included** | `npm install` instead of `npm ci --omit=dev` | Use `npm ci --omit=dev` (Node), `pip install --no-dev` (Python), `-DskipTests` (Maven) | **MEDIUM — faster install, smaller image** |
| **Large base image** | `FROM node:22` (~1GB) or `FROM python:3.13` (~900MB) | Switch to alpine/slim: `node:22-alpine` (~180MB), `python:3.13-slim` (~150MB) | **MEDIUM — faster pull, less to build on** |
| **Redundant RUN layers** | Multiple `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install` | Combine into single `RUN` with `&&` | **LOW-MEDIUM — fewer layers** |
| **No build cache mounts** | Dependencies re-downloaded on every build even when unchanged | Use `--mount=type=cache` for package manager caches | **HIGH — near-instant dependency installs on cache hit** |
| **Large files in build context** | `.git` directory (can be hundreds of MB), data files, media | Add to `.dockerignore` | **HIGH — context upload is a hidden time sink** |
| **Tests running in build** | `RUN npm test` or `RUN pytest` in Dockerfile | Move tests to CI pipeline (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI), not Docker build | **MEDIUM — testing should be separate** |
| **Downloading during build** | `RUN curl ... | RUN wget ...` downloading large files | Pre-bake into base image or use multi-stage with a download stage | **MEDIUM — network I/O during build is slow** |

**Step 2: Propose optimized Dockerfile**

For each anti-pattern found, show the user the exact before/after change. Here are the key patterns:

**Optimal layer ordering (the single biggest win):**

```dockerfile
# BAD — every code change invalidates the dependency cache
FROM node:22-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .                    # ← This invalidates everything below on ANY code change
RUN npm install             # ← Re-installs ALL dependencies every time
RUN npm run build

# GOOD — dependencies are cached, only code changes trigger rebuild
FROM node:22-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./    # ← Only changes when deps change
RUN npm ci --omit=dev                      # ← Cached layer when deps haven't changed
COPY . .                                   # ← Only code changes trigger from here
RUN npm run build
```

**Build cache mounts (advanced — near-instant dependency installs):**

```dockerfile
# Node.js — cache npm modules across builds
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm \
    npm ci --omit=dev

# Python — cache pip packages
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip \
    pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Go — cache Go modules
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/go/pkg/mod \
    go mod download

# Maven — cache .m2 repository
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.m2 \
    ./mvnw package -DskipTests -B

# Gradle — cache Gradle home
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.gradle \
    ./gradlew bootJar --no-daemon -x test
```

**Multi-stage builds (smaller final image = faster push + pull):**

```dockerfile
# Build stage — has all build tools, dev deps, compilers
FROM node:22-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Runtime stage — minimal, only production artifacts
FROM node:22-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --omit=dev && npm cache clean --force
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

**Optimal `.dockerignore`:**

```dockerignore
.git
.gitignore
.env
.env.*
*.md
LICENSE
docker-compose*.yml
Dockerfile
.dockerignore
node_modules
.next
dist
build
coverage
.nyc_output
__pycache__
*.pyc
.venv
venv
.pytest_cache
target
.gradle
.idea
.vscode
*.swp
```

### 3.2 Build Runner Resource Analysis

Use the Grafana snapshot from Phase 1.2 to check if the build runner is resource-constrained:

| Observation | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| CPU at 100% throughout build | Build runner CPU-bound | Contact Qovery support — needs larger build runner |
| Memory near limit / OOM | Build runner memory-bound | Contact Qovery support — needs more memory |
| CPU/memory well within limits | Build runner is fine — Dockerfile is the bottleneck | Focus on Dockerfile optimization (Phase 3.1) |
| Network I/O spikes | Downloading large dependencies | Use build cache mounts, pre-bake dependencies |

Share the Grafana snapshot URL with the user:
> "Here's the build runner resource usage for your last deployment: {report_url}
> It shows CPU, memory, and network I/O during the build. The snapshot expires in 24 hours."

### 3.3 Application Startup Optimization

If the app startup is the bottleneck (time between container starting and health check passing):

| Pattern | Detection (from logs) | Fix | Auto-Fix? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **JVM cold start** | `Started ... in X seconds` with X > 30 | Use CDS (Class Data Sharing), Spring AOT, or GraalVM native image; or accept it and increase `initial_delay_seconds` | ASK (code change) / YES (probe config) |
| **Database migrations on start** | Migration logs during startup | Move migrations to a lifecycle job (runs once per deploy, not per pod) | ASK |
| **Downloading assets on start** | HTTP download logs during startup | Pre-bake assets into the Docker image at build time | ASK |
| **Loading large ML models** | Model loading logs, several minutes | Pre-bake model into image, or use init container, or increase startup probe timeout | ASK |
| **Waiting for dependencies** | Retry/connection logs to DB/Redis | Ensure deployment stages order dependencies first; add retry logic with exponential backoff | YES (stages) / ASK (code) |
| **Expensive initialization** | Custom init code (warming caches, pre-computing) | Defer non-critical initialization to after health check passes; use readiness probe to signal when ready | ASK |
| **Slow DNS resolution** | DNS timeout logs | Check if `ndots` configuration is causing excessive DNS lookups (common in K8s) | Contact Qovery support |

**Measure actual startup time:**

```bash
# Port-forward and time the first successful response
qovery port-forward --service "name" --port 8080:8080
time curl http://localhost:8080/health
# The time from container start to first successful health response = actual startup time
```

### 3.4 Health Check Tuning

Health check misconfiguration is one of the easiest wins — pure Qovery config changes, no code needed.

**Get current health check config:**

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Token $QOVERY_API_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.qovery.com/application/{appId}" | jq '.healthchecks'
```

**Common misconfigurations and fixes:**

| Problem | Detection | Optimal Config | Auto-Fix? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `initial_delay_seconds` too high | App starts in 5s but delay is 120s — wasting 115s | Set to `actual_startup_time + 10s` | YES |
| `initial_delay_seconds` too low | App starts in 60s but delay is 10s — probe fails, pod restarts | Set to `actual_startup_time + 30s` | YES |
| `period_seconds` too high | Probes every 30s — slow readiness detection | Set to 5-10s | YES |
| `failure_threshold` too low | Set to 1 — single slow response kills the pod | Set to 3-5 | YES |
| `timeout_seconds` too low | Set to 1s but health endpoint needs 3s | Set to 5s, or optimize the health endpoint | YES |
| HTTP probe on slow endpoint | `/health` queries database, takes 3s | Create lightweight `/healthz` that returns 200 immediately | ASK (code change) |
| No readiness probe | Only liveness — Kubernetes sends traffic before app is ready | Add readiness probe (same endpoint, lower `initial_delay_seconds`) | YES |

**Optimal health check config by framework:**

| Framework | Typical Startup | Recommended `initial_delay_seconds` | Health Endpoint |
|---|---|---|---|
| Node.js (Express/Fastify) | 1-5s | 10s | `/health` |
| Next.js | 3-10s | 15s | `/` or `/api/health` |
| Python (Flask/FastAPI) | 2-5s | 10s | `/health` |
| Python (Django) | 5-15s | 20s | `/health` |
| Go | 1-3s | 5s | `/health` |
| Java (Spring Boot) | 15-60s | 60-120s | `/actuator/health` |
| Ruby (Rails) | 10-30s | 30s | `/health` |
| .NET | 5-15s | 20s | `/health` |

**Fix health check via API (auto-fix):**

```bash
# Tune health check timing based on actual startup time
curl -s -X PUT "https://api.qovery.com/application/{appId}" \
  -H "Authorization: Token $QOVERY_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "healthchecks": {
      "readiness_probe": {
        "type": {"http": {"port": 8080, "scheme": "HTTP", "path": "/health"}},
        "initial_delay_seconds": 10,
        "period_seconds": 5,
        "timeout_seconds": 5,
        "success_threshold": 1,
        "failure_threshold": 3
      },
      "liveness_probe": {
        "type": {"http": {"port": 8080, "scheme": "HTTP", "path": "/health"}},
        "initial_delay_seconds": 30,
        "period_seconds": 10,
        "timeout_seconds": 5,
        "success_threshold": 1,
        "failure_threshold": 3
      }
    }
  }'
```

### 3.5 Pod Scheduling Optimization

If Kubernetes takes >2 min to schedule the pod:

| Cause | Detection | Fix | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| **No available nodes** | Karpenter provisioning new node (~2 min) | Expected on first deploy or scale-up. Diversify instance types in Karpenter for faster matching. | Qovery (cluster config) |
| **Resource requests too high** | Pod requests 4 CPU + 8GB but workload uses 500m + 512MB | Right-size resource requests (see qovery-optimize skill) | User — auto-fix |
| **Node startup time** | New EC2/GCE instance takes 2-3 min to join cluster | Expected. Keep at least 1-2 warm nodes by setting `min_running_instances >= 1` | Mixed |
| **Image pull slow** | Large image (>1GB) pulling from remote registry | See Phase 3.6 (Container Image Optimization) | User (image size) |
| **Anti-affinity/topology rules** | Pod can't be scheduled due to spread constraints | Review pod anti-affinity rules | Qovery/User |

### 3.6 Container Image Pull Optimization

For services using pre-built images from a container registry (not Git-based builds), the image pull is often the bottleneck.

**Image size benchmarks:**

| Size | Pull Time (typical) | Rating |
|---|---|---|
| < 100MB | 5-15s | Excellent |
| 100-500MB | 15-45s | Good |
| 500MB-1GB | 45-90s | Needs optimization |
| > 1GB | 90-180s+ | Bad — optimize immediately |

**Optimization strategies:**

| Strategy | Impact | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Use alpine/slim base images** | -50-80% image size | `FROM node:22-alpine` instead of `FROM node:22` |
| **Multi-stage builds** | -50-80% | Build in one stage, copy only artifacts to runtime stage |
| **Remove unnecessary files** | -10-30% | Delete temp files, caches, docs in final stage |
| **Use `.dockerignore`** | -10-50% context size | Exclude `.git`, `node_modules`, test files |
| **Minimize layers** | -5-10% | Combine RUN commands, clean up in same layer |
| **Share base layers** | -20-50% pull time | Use the same base image for multiple services (layers are cached on nodes) |
| **Use Qovery's built-in registry** | Faster pulls | Images built by Qovery are already in a registry close to the cluster |

**Check current image size:**

```bash
# For container services, check the tag and image size in the registry
curl -s -H "Authorization: Token $QOVERY_API_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.qovery.com/container/{containerId}" | jq '{image_name, tag}'

# Check image size locally (if you have Docker)
docker pull {image}:{tag}
docker images {image}:{tag} --format "table {{.Repository}}\t{{.Tag}}\t{{.Size}}"
```

**Layer sharing optimization:**

If you have multiple services using different base images, standardize on one:
```
BEFORE:
  backend:  FROM node:22 (1GB)
  frontend: FROM node:22-slim (200MB)
  worker:   FROM node:20 (1GB)

AFTER (shared base = node:22-alpine pulled once, cached on every node):
  backend:  FROM node:22-alpine (180MB)
  frontend: FROM node:22-alpine (180MB)
  worker:   FROM node:22-alpine (180MB)
```

### 3.7 Deployment Stage Parallelism

If the environment has multiple deployment stages running serially, check if independent services can be parallelized:

**Get current stage configuration:**

The V2 deployment history already shows stages and their durations. Check if services in different stages are actually independent.

```
CURRENT (serial — everything sequential):
  Stage 1: Database (3m)
  Stage 2: Backend (8m)
  Stage 3: Frontend (5m)
  Stage 4: Jobs (1m 30s)
  Total: 17m 30s

OPTIMIZED (parallel where possible):
  Stage 1: Database (3m)              — must be first (backend depends on it)
  Stage 2: Backend + Frontend (8m)    — frontend doesn't depend on backend at DEPLOY time
  Stage 3: Jobs (1m 30s)             — migration depends on backend
  Total: 12m 30s (saved 5m — 29% improvement!)
```

**Rules for parallelization:**
- Services that DON'T depend on each other can be in the SAME stage
- Databases MUST be in an earlier stage than apps that connect to them
- Lifecycle jobs that run migrations MUST be after the backend (same or later stage)
- Frontends often DON'T depend on backends at deploy time (they connect at runtime via env vars)

**Fix via API (auto-fix — move services to same stage):**

```bash
# Move frontend to the same stage as backend (they're independent at deploy time)
curl -s -X PUT "https://api.qovery.com/application/{frontendId}" \
  -H "Authorization: Token $QOVERY_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"deployment_stage_id": "{backendStageId}"}'
```

---

## PHASE 4: Fix & Verify

### 4.1 Auto-Fix Rules

Same rules as other Qovery skills:

**AUTO-FIX ALLOWED (no permission needed):**
- Health check timing (`initial_delay_seconds`, `period_seconds`, `failure_threshold`, `timeout_seconds`)
- Health check type switching (HTTP to TCP)
- Deployment stage reordering / merging (parallelizing independent services)
- `.dockerignore` creation
- Resource request adjustments (if over-requested)

**MUST ASK USER BEFORE FIXING:**
- Any Dockerfile modifications (even optimizations — it's user code)
- Application startup code changes (moving migrations, deferring init)
- Adding build cache mounts to Dockerfile
- Creating a new lightweight health endpoint
- Changing base images
- Any change to user code

**WHEN ASKING, always:**
1. Show the current Dockerfile / code section
2. Show the proposed change with before/after diff
3. Explain the expected time saving
4. Wait for explicit approval

### 4.2 Apply Fixes and Re-Measure

After applying fixes:

1. **Trigger a new deployment:**
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST "https://api.qovery.com/environment/{envId}/deploy" \
     -H "Authorization: Token $QOVERY_API_TOKEN"
   # Or via MCP: "Redeploy the production environment"
   # Or via CLI: qovery environment deploy
   ```

2. **Wait for it to complete and gather the new timeline:**
   ```bash
   # Wait, then fetch the latest deployment from V2 history
   curl -s -H "Authorization: Token $QOVERY_API_TOKEN" \
     "https://api.qovery.com/environment/{envId}/deploymentHistoryV2?pageSize=1" | jq
   ```

3. **Compare before vs after:**
   ```
   Deployment Speed Improvement:

   | Step          | Before  | After   | Saved   | Improvement |
   |---------------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
   | Docker Build  | 8m 42s  | 2m 15s  | 6m 27s  | 74%         |
   | App Startup   | 1m 50s  | 1m 50s  | —       | —           |
   | Health Check  | 1m 30s  | 0m 20s  | 1m 10s  | 78%         |
   | Stage Parallel| —       | —       | 5m 00s  | 29%         |
   | TOTAL         | 17m 30s | 5m 15s  | 12m 15s | 70%         |
   ```

4. **Present results to the user** with clear before/after comparison.

## PHASE 5: Qovery Support Escalation

If the bottleneck is on Qovery's infrastructure side, generate a diagnostic report and offer to share with support.

### 5.1 When to Escalate

Escalate to Qovery support when:
- **Queue time >2 min** consistently
- **Build runner CPU at 100%** — needs larger build runner allocation
- **Build runner memory near limit** — risk of OOM during build
- **Image push takes >2 min** with a reasonably-sized image (<500MB)
- **Pod scheduling >2 min** consistently even with right-sized resource requests
- **Karpenter not provisioning nodes** in a timely manner

### 5.2 Generate Diagnostic Report

Save to `.qovery/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-deployment-speed.md`:

```markdown
# Deployment Speed Diagnostic Report

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Service:** {name}
**Environment:** {name}
**Cluster:** {name} ({cloud_provider}, {region})

## Timeline Analysis (Last 5 Deployments)

| # | Date | Total | Queue | Build | Push | Schedule | Startup | Health | Status |
|---|------|-------|-------|-------|------|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| 5 | 4/20 | 12:34 | 0:15  | 8:42  | 0:45 | 0:22     | 1:50    | 0:32   | OK     |
| 4 | 4/19 | 11:22 | 0:10  | 7:50  | 0:40 | 0:20     | 1:45    | 0:30   | OK     |
| 3 | 4/18 | 14:10 | 0:18  | 10:05 | 0:50 | 0:25     | 1:50    | 0:32   | OK     |
| 2 | 4/17 | 6:45  | 0:12  | 4:12  | 0:35 | 0:18     | 1:20    | 0:28   | OK     |
| 1 | 4/15 | 6:30  | 0:10  | 4:05  | 0:30 | 0:15     | 1:20    | 0:30   | OK     |

## Identified Bottleneck

**Step:** {step name}
**Owner:** Qovery infrastructure
**Details:** {specific diagnosis — e.g., "Build runner CPU consistently at 100% throughout the 8-minute build. The Grafana snapshot confirms CPU saturation. Dockerfile has already been optimized (proper layer ordering, .dockerignore, multi-stage build, cache mounts)."}

## Build Runner Usage Report

**Grafana Snapshot URL:** {report_url from API}
*(Expires in 24 hours — please review before expiration)*

## User-Side Optimizations Already Applied

- [x] Dockerfile layer ordering optimized
- [x] .dockerignore configured
- [x] Multi-stage build in place
- [x] Build cache mounts added
- [x] Health check timing tuned
- [x] Deployment stages parallelized

## Recommendation

Please review the build runner CPU/memory allocation for cluster "{cluster_name}" in region {region}. The current build runner resources appear insufficient for this application's build requirements.

## Service Configuration

- Build mode: DOCKER
- Dockerfile: {path}
- CPU: {cpu}m
- Memory: {memory}MB
- Instances: {min}-{max}
- Health check: {type} on port {port}, path {path}, initial_delay {delay}s
```

### 5.3 Offer to Contact Qovery Support

## PHASE 6: Deployment Speed Targets & Ongoing Monitoring

### 6.1 What's a Reasonable Deployment Time?

| Application Type | Good | Acceptable | Needs Optimization |
|---|---|---|---|
| Simple Node.js/Go app (small codebase) | 1-3 min | 3-5 min | >5 min |
| React/Vite SPA (frontend) | 2-4 min | 4-7 min | >7 min |
| Next.js (SSR + build) | 3-6 min | 6-10 min | >10 min |
| Python (Flask/FastAPI/Django) | 1-4 min | 4-7 min | >7 min |
| Java (Spring Boot, Maven) | 3-8 min | 8-12 min | >12 min |
| Java (Spring Boot, Gradle) | 2-6 min | 6-10 min | >10 min |
| Go (compiled binary) | 1-3 min | 3-5 min | >5 min |
| .NET (ASP.NET Core) | 2-5 min | 5-8 min | >8 min |
| Container from registry (no build) | 30s-2 min | 2-4 min | >4 min |
| Helm chart | 1-5 min | 5-10 min | >10 min |
| Terraform service | 2-10 min | 10-20 min | Depends on resources |

### 6.2 Save Benchmark Report

Save the analysis to `.qovery/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-deployment-speed.md` for future comparison:

```bash
# Ask user if they want to commit
git add .qovery/reports/
git commit -m "docs: add deployment speed analysis YYYY-MM-DD"
```

### 6.3 When to Re-Analyze

Suggest re-running this analysis when:
- Adding significant new dependencies (larger `node_modules`, new Maven deps)
- Upgrading frameworks (new Next.js version, Spring Boot upgrade)
- Changing Dockerfiles
- Adding new services to the environment
- After Qovery cluster upgrades
- When deployment time noticeably regresses

### 6.4 Continuous Improvement Checklist

After optimization, provide the user with a checklist for maintaining fast deployments:

```markdown
## Deployment Speed Maintenance Checklist

- [ ] Dockerfile has proper layer ordering (lockfiles first, then code)
- [ ] .dockerignore excludes .git, node_modules, build artifacts
- [ ] Multi-stage build separates build and runtime
- [ ] Alpine/slim base images used where possible
- [ ] Dependencies installed with --production/--omit=dev flags
- [ ] Build cache mounts used for package manager caches
- [ ] Health check initial_delay_seconds matches actual startup time + buffer
- [ ] Both readiness and liveness probes configured
- [ ] Independent services are in the same deployment stage
- [ ] Database is in an earlier stage than the apps that need it
- [ ] No tests running inside Docker build (moved to CI)
- [ ] No large file downloads during app startup
- [ ] Database migrations run as lifecycle job, not during app startup
```
